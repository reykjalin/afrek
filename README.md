# Afrek

Simple task management and focusing software.

## Start developing Afrek

Afrek's frontend and backend have to be served via separate commands:

### Run the backend

```shell
php artisan serve
```

### Prepare the frontend

```shell
npm i
```

### Run the frontend

```shell
npm run dev
```

And now the app should be available on http://localhost:8000/.
