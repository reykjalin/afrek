		<p>Non-identifiable data collected by this website is limited to the following:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Task information manually entered by users: task title, details, duration, and scheduled
				date.

		</ul>

		<p>
			Data collected will never be sold, given, or otherwise provided in any way to third parties.

		<p>
			Task data is stored in plain text. This data will only be looked at by myself, or a member
			of my team if there ever will be one, in the case where a bug is reported related to a
			specific task, in which case only the tasks of that user will be looked at. While every
			effort will be made to never look at task data, Afrek is not an appropriate platform for
			data requiring maximum security, such as business critical information, financial or banking
			information, passwords, or the like.

		<p>
			You can request to have your data deleted at any time by emailing me at the address in the
			footer of this page, in which case all your data will be wiped completely. You can also
			request to have your data exported at any time by emailing me at the address in the footer
			of this page, in which case you will receive a compressed file containing all your data
			within 30 days.
